# Hope lexicon ü§ûüíö

This lexicon was built following the approach of Guerra et al<sup>1</sup>.
According to the Collins dictionary, ‚ÄúHope is a feeling of desire and expectation that things will go well in the future.‚Äù, therefore something to be hopeful needs to be a subjective anticipation of a positive outcome. 
To identify words with these features, we utilized the [NRCLex library](https://pypi.org/project/NRCLex/) to cross-reference the dictionaries for the categories "anticipation," "positive," and "joy." We selected words that exhibited "anticipation," at least one of either "positive" or "joy," and were also considered subjective. To meet this third requirement, we utilized the [`textblob.subjectivity`](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api_reference.html#textblob.blob.TextBlob.subjectivity) function, which assigns a score ranging from 0 (not subjective) to 1 (very subjective), and we only selected words with a score higher than 0.5.
The resulting lexicon contains 221 words. 

To ease the integration of this lexicon with the other affect categories of the NRC EmoLex<sup>2</sup>, the file `hope.txt` is formatted as the files available at https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm.
